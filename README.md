## Introduction

The Complex Calculator project aims to create a versatile calculator capable of handling complex equations with various mathematical operations. It ensures correct precedence of operators and supports decimal numbers and negative values. Additionally, the project includes a feature to reset the LCD screen, allowing users to calculate multiple equations consecutively.

## Features

- Support for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) operations.
- Precedence rules for correct evaluation of complex equations.
- Acceptance of floating-point and negative numbers.
- LCD reset key for easy calculation of multiple equations.

## Hardware Requirements

To run the Stopwatch project, the following hardware components are required:

- TivaC TM4C123GXL microcontroller board.
- Push buttons for reset and pause time functionality.
- Appropriate connectors and wiring.

  
## Usage

To use the Complex Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Power on the calculator.
2. Enter the equation using the provided keypad and LCD screen.
3. Ensure proper syntax and use parentheses to indicate precedence if required.
4. Press the "=" key to evaluate the equation.
5. The result will be displayed on the LCD screen.
6. To calculate another equation, press the LCD reset key to clear the screen.

## Installation

To install and run the Complex Calculator project, follow these steps:

1. Download the project files from the repository.
2. Set up the appropriate development environment, such as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
3. Configure the IDE to include the necessary libraries and dependencies for the microcontroller or platform being used.
4. Import the project files into the IDE.
5. Build the project to generate the executable file.
6. Connect the keypad, LCD screen, and any other required hardware components to the microcontroller or platform.
7. Flash the executable file onto the microcontroller or platform.
8. Power on the system to start using the Complex Calculator.
